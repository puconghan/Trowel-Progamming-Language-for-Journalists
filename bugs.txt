Printing with variables:

Currently we correctly detect which tokens are variables and detect their value. However the output of:
	number x is 5
	print x
	
	should be:
	
	x = 5
	print x
	
	currently it is:
	
	x = 5
	print "5"

	Failing tests:
	
	def test_two_line_assign_print(self):
		self.assertEqual(trowel.main([None, r'number temp is 5\nprint temp']), ["temp = 5", "print temp"])
		self.assertEqual(trowel.main([None, r'text temp is "this is text"\nprint temp']), ["temp = \"this is temp\""])
		self.assertEqual(trowel.main([None, r'url temp is \'this is text\'\nprint temp']), ["temp = \"this is text\"", "print temp"])
