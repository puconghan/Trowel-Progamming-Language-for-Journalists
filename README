THIS IS THE README FOR TROWEL
-----------------------------

Input programs can be compiled in Trowel using:
./trowel filename.twl

The output will be saved as filename.py, and executed at the same time.
(The tokens will be saved to tokens.twl, and AST will be saved to asl.twl)

The source files of trowel are:
-------------------------------
1. trowelc.py - This is the main controller for the compiler
2. lexingrules.py - Contains the rules for token generation using PLY
3. parsingrules.py - Contains the grammar for generating the AST using PLY
4. trowelglobals.py - Contains the global objects that are shared, and modules for error handling
5. trowelfunctions.py - Contains the implementation for inbuilt functions

Additionally
5. compilerTest.py - Contains tests to verify that each module is working correctly
5. outputTest.py - Contains tests to verify that the output of the compiler is correct
